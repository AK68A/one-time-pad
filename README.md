# one-time-pad

One-time Pad was the first encryption technique I learned when studying Cryptography. After wrapping my mind around the concept of XOR functions and its use in One-time Pad, I was eager to apply it to programming. I chose the Python programming language because it is a popular language in the Cybersecurity field.

This is the first Python program I have ever written. It is written from scratch using the grit and a fundamental understanding of Computer Science, using what I believe are best practices to write clean code. 

I also wrote an [article](https://ak68a.com/xor-and-one-time-pad/) to encapsulate One-time Pad and XOR logic using this program as a demonstration.
